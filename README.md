# Metasploit – TCM Security Lab

This section documents my practical use of the Metasploit Framework within a course-provided lab environment from TCM Security Academy.

## Objectives
- Understand Metasploit architecture
- Identify and select exploit modules
- Gain initial access to vulnerable systems
- Perform basic post-exploitation tasks

# Metasploit Exploitation Workflow

## 1. Enumeration
Initial service enumeration was performed to identify running services and versions that could be vulnerable.

## 2. Exploit Selection
Appropriate Metasploit exploit modules were selected based on service version matching and exploit reliability.

## 3. Exploitation
The exploit was executed successfully, providing shell access to the target system.

## 4. Post-Exploitation
- Verified access level using standard system commands
- Enumerated system and network information
- Assessed potential privilege escalation vectors

## Key Takeaways
- Accurate enumeration is critical for successful exploitation
- Outdated services present significant security risks
- Metasploit is effective when used responsibly in controlled environments

# Metasploit Commands Used
